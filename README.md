# Major Project
 major project submitted in final semester
 
 
 **DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT**
 
 The project is based on _disease prediction system_.
 
 It has two modules - 
 1. Heart attack prediction system
 2. Depression, Hypertension and Diabetes prediction system
 
 The user will fill the respective fields provided to the user in the medical report.
 The software will predict the chances of disease.
 If chances of disease are higher, the software will suggest doctor for the same.
 
 _FOR ANALYSIS_
 1. In heart attack prediciton, I have used _Logistic Regression_ with an accuracy of 0.88.

 2. In diabetes, hypertension and depression prediction, I have used _Random Forest Regressor_
